NAME
  fpcc-comp - Compare and compute fingerprint resemblance/containment

SYNOPSIS
  fpcc comp [-b basefile] [-c|-i] [-t threshold] sigfile1 sigfile2
  fpcc comp [-b basefile] [-c|-i] [-t threshold] -L filelist

DESCRIPTION
  fpcc-comp compares the specified fingerprint indices as produced
  by fpcc-idx(1) and
  reports a quantitative similarity (resemblance/containment).

OPTIONS
  -b basefile     The fingerprint of which hashes are ignored.
  -c              Output comparison results in a csv-format
                  file1;file2;rb;ct1;ct2, where
                  rb  is resemblance of the two documents
                  ct1  is containment of file1 in file2
                  ct2  is containment of file2 in file1
                  rb,ct1,ct2  are in the range from 0 to 100.
  -i              Compute containment instead of resemblance
                  (in csv format, both resemblance and containment are always
                  computed)
  -t threshold    Suppress reporting below the specified threshold. Default: 0
  -L filelist     Path to a file containing the list of files to compare to
                  each other; each path must be on a separate line.

EXAMPLES
  Compare two fingerprint indices for resemblance:

    $ fpcc comp myproj.sig otherproj.sig

  Read a list of fingerprint indices from a file and perform an n-to-n
  comparison:

    $ fpcc comp -L allsigs.txt
