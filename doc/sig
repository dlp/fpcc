NAME
  fpcc-sig - create fingerprints for C source code files
SYNOPSIS
  fpcc sig [-n chainlength] [-w winnow] file...
DESCRIPTION
  fpcc-sig computes hashes from lexical tokens from the C source files provided
  as arguments, which form the fingerprints for the set of documents. The
  output is written in plain text to stdout. Input files are processed in
  order. For each file, first the absolute, resolved canonical filename is
  printed, followed by the hashes, one in each line together with the
  approximate line number of its origin, separated by a single space.
OPTIONS
  -n chainlength  Number of tokens to form n-grams. Default: 5
  -w winnow       Window size of the winnowing algorithm. Default: 4
EXAMPLE
  find . -name "*.c" -exec fpcc sig '{}' \\+ | fpcc idx -o myproject.sig
SEE ALSO
  fpcc-idx(1), fpcc-comp(1)
