NAME
  fpcc-diff - Display matching sections of two files

SYNOPSIS
  fpcc diff [-y] [target.sig source.sig]

DESCRIPTION
  fpcc-diff is a tool that interprets the output of fpcc-map(1) from
  stdin and displays the respective regions.
  If target.sig and source.sig are specified, instead of reading from
  stdin it invokes fpcc-map(1) itself (with no options).

  If the GNU source-highlight tool is installed, fpcc-diff uses
  it to display the C source (unless -y is specified, because highlighting
  messes up the two-column formatting).

OPTIONS
  -y  Enable side-by-side view (without highlighting only).

EXAMPLES
  Reading the output from fpcc-map(1) from stdin:

    $ fpcc map myproj.sig otherproj.sig | fpcc diff

  Invoke fpcc-map(1) implicitly:

    $ fpcc diff myproj.sig otherproj.sig
